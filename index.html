        <h2>About me</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Hello! I'm Jaishwanth Arun, a passionate Computer Science student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. My journey in the world of technology has been both exciting and fulfilling, marked by my enthusiasm for coding and my love for cars.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From a young age, I've been fascinated by the intricate workings of technology and the endless possibilities it offers. This curiosity led me to pursue Computer Science, where I've been honing my skills in various programming languages and exploring the ever-evolving landscape of software development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me delving into the world of automobiles. Cars have always captivated me, not just as machines, but as marvels of engineering and design. This dual passion for technology and cars drives me to constantly learn, innovate, and push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch!</p>
